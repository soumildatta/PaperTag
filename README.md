# PaperTag ðŸ“šðŸ”–

Ever download a research paper and end up with a file named something like `12345abc.pdf`? Yeah, we've all been there. ðŸ˜…
This handy little CLI tool quickly renames your research paper PDFs to their actual titles, making your academic life a little less chaotic and a lot more organized. 

### How it works:
1. Feed PaperTag the directory with a bunch of messy-named academic paper PDFs.
2. It peeks inside to find the real title.
3. It renames each PDF if it can parse the title.

### Usage:
Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

Then run the program using
```bash
python papertag.py
```
Enter the name of the directory when prompted.

### Contributions
Feel free to suggest new features or contribute to this tool to make everyone's research journey a little easier.
